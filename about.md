## About me
I'm a postdoctoral fellow at Exeter University, working on Computational Astrophysics (the formation and evolution of groups of stars in the galaxy) in the team of Clare Dobbs.
Previously I was at [R-CCS](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/ "RIKEN Center for Computational Science") in the team of Jun Makino.
Before that, I worked as a postdoc at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in Groningen with Rien van de Weijgaert and as a PhD candidate at Sterrewacht Leiden with Simon Portegies Zwart.

My research focuses on N-body simulations on various scales, from planets to cosmology, and the connection between these different scales.
I combine simulations on different scales to see the effect one has on the other, for example when a star cluster is embedded in a galaxy.
For these simulations I mainly use [AMUSE](https://github.com/amusecode/amuse "Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment"), which I am a developer of.
